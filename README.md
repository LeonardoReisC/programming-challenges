# programming-challenges

This repository hosts solutions to various programming challenges developed in Python!

## Getting Started

To run the solutions, navigate to the challenge directory and execute the following commands:

- **Clone the Repository**

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/LeonardoReisC/programming-challenges.git
  ```

- **Navigate to the Challenge Directory**

  ```bash
  cd <challenge-directory>
  ```

- **Run the Python File**

  ```bash
  python3 main.py < input.txt > output.txt
  ```

- **Compare the output**

  ```bash
  diff output.txt expected_output.txt
  ```

  If there are no differences between the `output.txt` and `expected_output.txt`, the solution has passed the test case.
